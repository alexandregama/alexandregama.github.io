[{"categories":["Podcast Review"],"contents":"Hey friend!\nI usually take some terrible handwritten notes when I\u0026rsquo;m reading a book and lately I\u0026rsquo;ve been following the same approach\nwhile listening podcasts\nIt helps me:\n Keeping my podcast list really short. Taking notes is really time consuming Being more active when it comes to consuming data Keeping my memory in some artificial place. The physical place is usually terrible When I need to revisit the most important lessons I\u0026rsquo;ve learned in the month  So I was wondering, why not share them? Let\u0026rsquo;s the journey begin..\nPodcast Review #1: How to create content daily I\u0026rsquo;m starting this kind of blog category here. Podcast Reviews.\nGoal?\n for folks who want to just see a review and decide if the topic is interesting for folks who want to just discover more content for folks who want to just laugh at my notes  Let\u0026rsquo;s start with the first episode in this series, which is from an amazing Podcast from Sean McCabe and Ben Toalson: How to create content daily\nIf you want to go to sleep, just take 2 notes:\nIf you have more time (or the same amount of time but a great level of curiosity)\nPodcast Focus We should create content daily (genius).\nSean and Ryan go from some important motivations behind this idea:\n you can avoid overthinking and just do it: share content probably you will spend the same amount of time doing it daily when comparing with doing it weekly you\u0026rsquo;ll learn way more faster putting content online and getting feedback  How to Here Sean and Ryan explore some patterns to follow\n first of all, forget imperfections. Just embrace it and learn through the journey and feedbacks split the content into several different parts and share them over the week recording a podcast? film yourself while you\u0026rsquo;re recording. You can share some important pieces via social media improve quality over time, but forget it for now. Focus on quantity with consistency even with fancy gear, you can keep it simple when it comes to sharing single pieces of content don\u0026rsquo;t worry about social media rules. Do you get something that  Biggest Lesson for me Keep it simple and forget imperfections. Share your journey, your progress. Document it.\nPeople love real life and real life has behind the scenes. We always love waiting to see the behind the scenes.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s keep in touch ðŸ™‚\nTwitter Youtube Linkedin\n","permalink":"https://www.alexgama.io/blog/podcast-review-1-how-to-create-content-daily/","tags":["Productivity"],"title":"Podcast Review #1: How to create content daily"},{"categories":["Frameworks"],"contents":"Hey friends!\nThis will be really short, I promise. This is the discovery of the day and I want to share it.\nAre you immersed in the JavaScript world? Or are you just getting started?\nIn both contexts probably you have heard about React. Old like me? Probably React.js\nReact Just a terrible overview:\n React is a JavaScript library React allows us to build rich user interfaces React allows us to build single-page applications React allows us to build mobile applications React is based on components  One interesting point is that React allows us to manipulate/render data. This is a more Stateless approach, which means that React has a short memory, on purpose btw.\n Request A renders my name on the page Request B completely forgets the rendered name  But usually, life works in mysterious ways and we need to know what happened previously. That\u0026rsquo;s when State Management comes handy.\nReact has friends. React has an important friend. Redux\nRedux If you want to have a good memory, if you want to be aware of the data you\u0026rsquo;re rendering between requests, then you\u0026rsquo;re thinking about Redux\nMy terrible overview again:\n Redux is a JavaScript Library (makes some sense, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?) Redux manages the application state Follows the reducing function approach (which I\u0026rsquo;m gonna tell you more about later)  it sounds that React has a new friend for State Management. Welcome Recoil :)\nRecoil I\u0026rsquo;ve just discovered Recoil from Twitter, as we discover everything in life.\nTo be honest, I don\u0026rsquo;t know yet how it works but the pitch is great\n You can share state easily Functional concepts in its core Create subscriptions to listen events asynchronously (my dream is to write this word correctly on the first attempt) Amazing granularity with Atoms and Selectors  If I have some time, I\u0026rsquo;ll play around with Recoil on my weekend and give you guys a better and detailed description.\nThanks for stopping by and see you tomorrow :)\nLet\u0026rsquo;s keep in touch ðŸ™‚\nTwitter Youtube Instagram Linkedin\n","permalink":"https://www.alexgama.io/blog/planning-to-manage-state-with-react-welcome-recoil/","tags":["GraphQL","Architecture"],"title":"Planning to Manage State with React? Welcome Recoil"},{"categories":["Architecture"],"contents":"Hey!\nAs I\u0026rsquo;ve documented here I\u0026rsquo;m documenting my journey in creating content, mostly related to Coding, Architecture, Frameworks but also related to Leadership, Startups, and Product Management, which are topics that I really love and learning a lot.\nThis will be a short intro to my blog set up. In the upcoming posts, I\u0026rsquo;ll describe other options and the \u0026ldquo;whys\u0026rdquo; behind the scenes\nStatic Site Generators (SSG) versus Content Management Systems (CMS) That was the first decision. Which one should I use?\nI wanted:\n A blazing fast blog Amazing Markdown support The possibility of avoiding databases usage Just worry about writing content  The requirements matched with Static Site Generators. Simple.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong again, CMSs are amazing also. We can even work with cache, JavaScript, etc to have a faster website, but this is a story for another post\nHugo vs Jekyll vs Gatsby vs Next All of them are amazing! Really!\nI picked **Hugo.\n Fast Simple Written in Go (I personally love) Really fast compilation Flexibility with Shortcodes and Markdown Good themes  Again. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong. Most of them have the same characteristics. Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s just a personal choice, but I\u0026rsquo;ll dissect my choices later\nHosting and Deployment Hugo provides us a beautiful list of places where you can host your site. Hugo renders static pages so you can probably host it anywhere\nHere is a small list:\n AWS Amplify Firebase AWS S3 GitLab Github Pages Netlify  I picked Github Pages\n It\u0026rsquo;s free It\u0026rsquo;s easy You can commit your posts It supports custom domains  Terribly short. I know. I just wanted to give you a taste of how my blog setup looks like\nNext posts I\u0026rsquo;ll explore a few important points:\n My personal comparison between Hugo and Jekyll How to set up an entire blog from scratch using Hugo, GitHub Pages and Godaddy How to choose a specific Hugo Theme How to write your first posts  That\u0026rsquo;s it for today!

Just a quick note: I haven\u0026rsquo;t hit the button yet Â¬Â¬\nToday I came across this Documenting instead of Creating process and I really loved the idea. Simple and powerful.\nThe way that Sean McCabe puts it really clicks with me. I\u0026rsquo;ve heard about the process before but for some reason I\u0026rsquo;m taking action just right now.\nWhat I desired to do with videos and blog posts? Well, I\u0026rsquo;d like to share content related to topics that I really love, that I\u0026rsquo;m learning and that I have no clue on how to get started\n Coding and Technology Productivity Leadership Business History Lifestyle Music  And the list goes on and on\nBut as a good overthinking person as I am, a have a full and complete set of questions that makes a good job in keeping me far away from my goals in sharing content:\n I\u0026rsquo;m not an English native speaker and I\u0026rsquo;ve learned (I\u0026rsquo;m still learning) English too old. I need to practice for more 5 years to be good enough I don\u0026rsquo;t have the right Youtube gear. What about spending the next 3 years on weekends studying Youtube gears to be good enough? People don\u0026rsquo;t care about what I want to say. Do I have to be creative to get attention? It\u0026rsquo;s a crowded world with amazing content. Why should I bother the world with what I\u0026rsquo;m thinking? This is wrong. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t have good quality. I\u0026rsquo;ll start it over again I have to find the perfect font for this blog What\u0026rsquo;s worth sharing? No one wants to see this  And the list goes on and one again\nAnd you find yourself stuck with a list of things that you can\u0026rsquo;t even see how to get started.\nAnd when you start looking for some answers about overthinking, a few interesting answers come up\nAnd then\nOk Google, that\u0026rsquo;s enough for today\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know about you, but when it comes to professional life, things are really different. For some bizarre reason!\n I\u0026rsquo;m super pragmatic, energetic, and I want to get things done as soon as possible with all of the imperfections because it\u0026rsquo;s amazing to adjust things along the way. It\u0026rsquo;s a beautiful and remarkable process. It really is.\n So, today is a really important day for me :)\nI\u0026rsquo;ll start embracing this terrible and uncomfortable zone of sharing content without overthinking things.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll start documenting the journey instead of overthinking about the content.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to face a lot of problems, imperfections, issues, people laughing at my grammar and pronunciation mistakes and to be honest, for some reason (maybe I\u0026rsquo;m getting too old to care about), I\u0026rsquo;m totally ok with that\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to capture this journey, the issues, the process I\u0026rsquo;m using to surround those issues and then, who knows, I\u0026rsquo;ll look at this in 10 years and I\u0026rsquo;ll be happy to just have started\nStay tuned if you want to see where it goes :)\nLet\u0026rsquo;s keep in touch ðŸ™‚\nTwitter Youtube Instagram Linkedin\n","permalink":"https://www.alexgama.io/blog/documenting-instead-of-creating-starting-the-journey/","tags":["Personal"],"title":"Documenting instead of Creating. Starting the Journey"},{"categories":["Personal"],"contents":"I came across this post titled \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m very slow thinker\u0026rdquo; by Derek Sivers and I really liked it. Not just because it\u0026rsquo;s well written but because it\u0026rsquo;s a detailed description of myself\nI usually take a lot of time thinking about questions. In meetings, I usually take notes. Lots of them, even in my head. I want to process them later.\nDo you want to ask me a question in the middle of the meeting? \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m thinking about it\u0026rdquo; will be the default answer, unless you press me firmly against the wall.\nSurprisingly, I usually have an answer and opinions for everything. Even for subjects that I don\u0026rsquo;t know or that I don\u0026rsquo;t care that much.\nBeing these answers and options right or wrong, I have them.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s an interesting scenario since I still want to think about my own opinions. The motivation? Challenging myself. A temptation to avoid some kind of cognitive bias. Or simply, I\u0026rsquo;m too slow\nProbably my first reaction, answer, and motivation will be outdated. I really believe that.\nIf I answer something really quickly, then in the second later, I\u0026rsquo;m trying to invalidate what I\u0026rsquo;ve sad.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not smart enough to have quick answers that are deep and valuable. I prefer to think about them for 5, 10 minutes. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll give you an answer next week.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll grab a beer and I promise thinking about your question while I\u0026rsquo;m sitting on my balcony\nBut I completely understand the art of imperfection and speed. And making decisions. I really do.\nIncomplete answers that can be improved over time. You can compound different perspectives while being in a discussion.\n\u0026ldquo;good is better than perfect\u0026rdquo; someone says. It\u0026rsquo;s outdated but true.\nProbably the brain side that knows it is different from the brain side that takes actions, that answers questions. Who knows.\nAs Derek says, this probably makes me stupid. Different from him, I\u0026rsquo;m usually worried about it. The acceptance phase is still coming. I\u0026rsquo;m waiting.

For 2 main reasons:\n Great discussions and tactical movements at our company. Really excited about what is coming ðŸš€ I started my journey in creating content. Finally :)  Social I\u0026rsquo;ve discovered Twitter and Linkedin again. Two completely different goals but they each have their places\nIt was great to see again how much I can learn while scrolling Twitter for 2 minutes. Of course, it depends on the type of people you follow\nPodcasts I\u0026rsquo;ve discovered this amazing Podcast from Sean McCabe. Fantastic! For the next week I\u0026rsquo;ll try a new experiment: I\u0026rsquo;ll share Podcasts Overview.\nYoutube I\u0026rsquo;ve finally hit the record button. Finally! It was tough. Really tough.\nMy voice is weird, my English is not good, you would completely forget your own name when you\u0026rsquo;re talking to the camera alone\nI hope to get better soon.\nBlog I\u0026rsquo;ve started one important commitment: write a piece of content every single day. That\u0026rsquo;s a hard but remarkable challenge! I\u0026rsquo;ve posted only 3 posts\nsince I decided to do that\n  Documenting instead of Creating. Starting the Journey\n  Iâ€™m a Very Slow Thinker\n  My Blog Set Up - Long Story Short going through Hugo and Github Pages\n  Just a quick note: it\u0026rsquo;s not easy to write a personal post. Really. But being vulnerable brings you to an interesting good environment, mentally at least.\nBooks I\u0026rsquo;ve finished The Ride of a Lifetime by Bob Iger, CEO of Disney (former CEO now) and I\u0026rsquo;m preparing a book review. It was an amazing ride, btw\nStats of this Week I\u0026rsquo;ve shared my posts on Medium. Well, 3 views ðŸ˜…. I\u0026rsquo;m not \u0026ldquo;how many views I\u0026rsquo;m having\u0026rdquo; kind of person and I don\u0026rsquo;t care that much about theses numbers\nBut hopefully Medium will like me a little bit more in the future :)\nAnalytics says a little bit different history. It seems a good start but I have no idea yet.\nI wouldn\u0026rsquo;t count these page views since they\u0026rsquo;re probably coming from myself setting up the blog ðŸ˜¬\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it!\nTerribly short but just to get the ball rolling.\nSee you and thanks for stopping by :)\n","permalink":"https://www.alexgama.io/blog/weekly-review-1/","tags":["Personal"],"title":"Weekly Review #1"}]
