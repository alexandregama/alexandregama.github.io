[{"categories":["Java"],"contents":"Hey friend!\nThis is Part 1 of the CDI Series in Java that contains:\n Part 1: Factory in CDI with the @Produces annotation Part 2: CDI Qualifiers Part 3: Events and Observers in CDI Part 4: CDI and Lazy Initialization Part 5: Interceptors in CDI Part 6: CDI Dependency Injection and Alternatives Part 7: Working with CDI Decorators  In this post, we\u0026rsquo;re going to take a look at the amazing @Produces annotation, which is probably one of the most important and used annotations in the CDI world in Java!\nSetting the expectation\nBefore getting started, let\u0026rsquo;s be on the same page. I\u0026rsquo;m not gonna go into so much detail about CDI and Dependency Injection because I\u0026rsquo;m kind of assuming you already know something about it. Forgive me if I\u0026rsquo;m wrong. Don\u0026rsquo;t be mad.\nThis series will be about some specific points on how to use CDI in your code. Let me know if you want more detailed points :)\nProblem contextualization\nIt\u0026rsquo;s time to contextualize our challenge! We\u0026rsquo;d like to create the following steps for our pseudo online store:\n Create a Checkout class to\u0026hellip; you know\u0026hellip; buy something Log the operations on the console. Create a Logger class to keep this log in its own class. The famous cohesion. Customize this Logger to receive a Configuration, which indicates which Log Mode should be used  Pretty simple, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? Let\u0026rsquo;s jump crazily into code!\n#1: Creating the Main class in CDI 2.0 Before creating the main class to execute our CDI code, let\u0026rsquo;s create the important Checkout class:\npublic class Checkout { public void finishCheckout() { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Finishing Checkout\u0026#34;); } } Great!\nIn this example, we\u0026rsquo;re going to use CDI 2.0, which allows us to use CDI in a standalone fashion!\nLet\u0026rsquo;s bring the CDI power by creating a CDI Container, which allows us to instantiate objects\nCDI\u0026lt;Object\u0026gt; container = new Weld().initialize() Nice! Below we have a Checkout object instance created by CDI:\npublic class MainApplication { public static void main(String[] args) { try (CDI\u0026lt;Object\u0026gt; container = new Weld().initialize()) { Checkout checkout = container.select(Checkout.class).get(); checkout.finishCheckout(); } } } Pretty easy, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? Notice the following code:\nCheckout checkout = container.select(Checkout.class).get(); That code is the same as the following, which is injecting a Checkout object using the remarkable @Inject annotation:\n@Inject private Checkout checkout; Now, it\u0026rsquo;s time to execute our CDI example, to validate our environment!\nYou will see on your console something like this:\nINFO: WELD-ENV-002003: Weld SE container STATIC_INSTANCE initialized Finishing Checkout Great! Everything is up and running!\n#2: Creating a Specialized Class for Logger Logging is something important for us. To have good cohesion, let\u0026rsquo;s create a class that is responsible for logging messages.\nThis class will be called SpecialLogger, as you can see below:\npublic class SpecialLogger { public void log(String message) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;LOG: \u0026#34; + message); //ok, not that special 😒  } } Perfect! Now we\u0026rsquo;d like to update the Checkout class to use the newest Logger class:\npublic class Checkout { private SpecialLogger logger; public void finishCheckout() { logger.log(\u0026#34;Finishing Checkout\u0026#34;); } } Sounds good, because now the Checkout class doesn\u0026rsquo;t know how a Logger works under the hood, we\u0026rsquo;re just using it!\n#3: Logging Mode to Log Messages Through a Special Configuration it would be great to have a way to change the mode that the log is printed out. These modes could be the following:\n Debug Mode Info Mode Error Mode Etc.  Our SpecialLogger should receive the desired Log Mode and print out the message using it.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s time to create the Configuration class that will receive the Log mode:\npublic class LogConfiguration { private boolean infoMode; private boolean debugMode; public LogConfiguration(boolean infoMode, boolean debugMode) { this.infoMode = infoMode; this.debugMode = debugMode; } public boolean isInInfoMode() { return infoMode; } public boolean isInDebugMode() { return debugMode; } } I know, that\u0026rsquo;s not the best code design, but I just want to keep the example clean and simple.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s change the SpecialLogger class to be able to Log a message based on the LogConfiguration:\npublic class SpecialLogger { @Inject private LogConfiguration configuration; public SpecialLogger(LogConfiguration configuration) { this.configuration = configuration; } public void log(String message) { if (configuration.isInDebugMode()) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;DEBUG LOG: \u0026#34; + message); } else if (configuration.isInInfoMode()) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;DEBUG LOG: \u0026#34; + message); } else { System.out.println(\u0026#34;DEFAULT LOG: \u0026#34; + message); } } } As you can see, we\u0026rsquo;re validating whether the log should use the Debug or Info mode, otherwise, the message must be printed out by using the Default mode.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s try to run it:\nWELD-001408: Unsatisfied dependencies for type SpecialLogger with qualifiers @Default at injection point [BackedAnnotatedField] @Inject private com.hackingcode.cdi.produces.Checkout.logger Yes, an exception will be thrown on our faces. And that makes sense. CDI does not know how to inject the SpecialLogger object yet.\nCDI, behind the scenes, will execute the following steps:\n Hey, I can see that you need a SpecialLogger object here. That\u0026rsquo;s ok for me. I\u0026rsquo;ll try to find this class around your classpath I\u0026rsquo;ve found this SpecialLogger class on your classpath I\u0026rsquo;ll try to create a new SpecialLogger instance for you right now Ohhh, I can\u0026rsquo;t do that! The SpecialLogger receives a LogConfiguration in its constructor. I don\u0026rsquo;t even know what it is and I don\u0026rsquo;t know how to create it!  It\u0026rsquo;s time to teach CDI how to get the job done and create the LogConfiguration class!\n#4: Creating a Factory With the @Produces Annotation It\u0026rsquo;s time to create a Factory to create the SpecialLogger based on the LogConfiguration:\npublic class SpecialLoggerFactory { public SpecialLogger createLogger() { LogConfiguration logInDebugMode = new LogConfiguration(true, false); return new SpecialLogger(logInDebugMode); } } It\u0026rsquo;s a pretty simple Factory class. It has the method createLogger(), which returns a LogConfiguration object.\nBut CDI doesn\u0026rsquo;t know about this class yet or its method! Let\u0026rsquo;s use the annotation @Produces.\npublic class SpecialLoggerFactory { @Produces public SpecialLogger createLogger() { LogConfiguration logInDebugMode = new LogConfiguration(true, false); return new SpecialLogger(logInDebugMode); } }  @Produces indicates to CDI that the method createLogger() should be used when a LogConfiguration object is needed\n The @Produces annotation will say to CDI:\n Hey CDI, please, use the createLogger() method when you need to Inject a SpecialLogger object in some place\n Of course, the returned object of the method createLogger() must be the same type that you\u0026rsquo;re interested in, in this case, the SpecialLogger. Generics for an upcoming post 😏.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it! I really hope that this article could be helpful to you!\nIn the next part, we\u0026rsquo;re going to be hacking some code with CDI and Qualifiers\nSee you on Twitter for more updates :)\nLet\u0026rsquo;s keep in touch and don\u0026rsquo;t forget to signup for my weekly newsletter 🙂\nTwitter Youtube Instagram Linkedin\n","permalink":"https://www.alexgama.io/java/cdi-series/cdi-in-java-series-part-1-creating-a-factory-using-produces-annotation/","tags":["CDI Series","Beginners Tutorial"],"title":"CDI in Java - Part 1 - Creating a Factory with @Produces Annotation"},{"categories":["Java"],"contents":"Hey!\nThis post is coming this week, I promise 😅\nJust join my newsletter to receive all updates :)\n","permalink":"https://www.alexgama.io/java/cdi-series/cdi-in-java-series-part-2-qualifiers/","tags":["CDI Series","Beginners Tutorial"],"title":"CDI in Java - Part 2 - Qualifiers"},{"categories":["Java"],"contents":"Hey!\nThis post is coming this week, I promise 😅\nJust join my newsletter to receive all updates :)\n","permalink":"https://www.alexgama.io/java/cdi-series/cdi-in-java-series-part-3-events-and-observers/","tags":["CDI Series","Beginners Tutorial"],"title":"CDI in Java - Part 3 - Events and Observers"},{"categories":["Java"],"contents":"Hey!\nThis post is coming this week, I promise 😅\nJust join my newsletter to receive all updates :)\n","permalink":"https://www.alexgama.io/java/cdi-series/cdi-in-java-series-part-4-lazy-initialization/","tags":["CDI Series","Beginners Tutorial"],"title":"CDI in Java - Part 4 - Lazy Initialization"},{"categories":["Java"],"contents":"Hey!\nThis post is coming this week, I promise 😅\nJust join my newsletter to receive all updates :)\n","permalink":"https://www.alexgama.io/java/cdi-series/cdi-in-java-series-part-5-interceptors/","tags":["CDI Series","Beginners Tutorial"],"title":"CDI in Java - Part 5 - Interceptors"},{"categories":["Java"],"contents":"Hey!\nThis post is coming this week, I promise 😅\nJust join my newsletter to receive all updates :)\n","permalink":"https://www.alexgama.io/java/cdi-series/cdi-in-java-series-part-6-dependency-injection-alternatives/","tags":["CDI Series","Beginners Tutorial"],"title":"CDI in Java - Part 6 - Dependency Injection and Alternatives"},{"categories":["Java"],"contents":"Hey!\nThis post is coming this week, I promise 😅\nJust join my newsletter to receive all updates :)\n","permalink":"https://www.alexgama.io/java/cdi-series/cdi-in-java-series-part-7-decorators/","tags":["CDI Series","Beginners Tutorial"],"title":"CDI in Java - Part 7 - Decorators"},{"categories":["Marketing"],"contents":"Hey!\nRunning out of time?

Taking notes is really time consuming Being more active when it comes to consuming data Keeping my memory in some artificial place. The physical place is usually terrible When I need to revisit the most important lessons I\u0026rsquo;ve learned in the month  So I was wondering, why not share them?

Just embrace it and learn through the journey and feedbacks split the content into several different parts and share them over the week recording a podcast? film yourself while you\u0026rsquo;re recording. You can share some important pieces via social media improve quality over time, but forget it for now. Focus on quantity with consistency even with fancy gear, you can keep it simple when it comes to sharing single pieces of content don\u0026rsquo;t worry about social media rules. Do you get something that  Biggest Lesson for me Keep it simple and forget imperfections. Share your journey, your progress. Document it.\nPeople love real life and real life has behind the scenes.

This is the discovery of the day and I want to share it.\nAre you immersed in the JavaScript world? Or are you just getting started?\nIn both contexts probably you have heard about React. Old like me? Probably React.js\nReact Just a terrible overview:\n React is a JavaScript library React allows us to build rich user interfaces React allows us to build single-page applications React allows us to build mobile applications React is based on components  One interesting point is that React allows us to manipulate/render data. This is a more Stateless approach, which means that React has a short memory, on purpose btw.\n Request A renders my name on the page Request B completely forgets the rendered name  But usually, life works in mysterious ways and we need to know what happened previously. That\u0026rsquo;s when State Management comes handy.\nReact has friends. React has an important friend. Redux\nRedux If you want to have a good memory, if you want to be aware of the data you\u0026rsquo;re rendering between requests, then you\u0026rsquo;re thinking about Redux\nMy terrible overview again:\n Redux is a JavaScript Library (makes some sense, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?) Redux manages the application state Follows the reducing function approach (which I\u0026rsquo;m gonna tell you more about later)  it sounds that React has a new friend for State Management. Welcome Recoil :)\nRecoil I\u0026rsquo;ve just discovered Recoil from Twitter, as we discover everything in life.\nTo be honest, I don\u0026rsquo;t know yet how it works but the pitch is great\n You can share state easily Functional concepts in its core Create subscriptions to listen events asynchronously (my dream is to write this word correctly on the first attempt) Amazing granularity with Atoms and Selectors  If I have some time, I\u0026rsquo;ll play around with Recoil on my weekend and give you guys a better and detailed description.\nThanks for stopping by and see you tomorrow :)\nLet\u0026rsquo;s keep in touch 🙂\nTwitter Youtube Instagram Linkedin\n","permalink":"https://www.alexgama.io/javascript/planning-to-manage-state-with-react-welcome-recoil/","tags":["GraphQL","Architecture"],"title":"Planning to Manage State with React?

In the upcoming posts, I\u0026rsquo;ll describe other options and the \u0026ldquo;whys\u0026rdquo; behind the scenes\nStatic Site Generators (SSG) versus Content Management Systems (CMS) That was the first decision. Which one should I use?\nI wanted:\n A blazing fast blog Amazing Markdown support The possibility of avoiding databases usage Just worry about writing content  The requirements matched with Static Site Generators. Simple.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong again, CMSs are amazing also. We can even work with cache, JavaScript, etc to have a faster website, but this is a story for another post\nHugo vs Jekyll vs Gatsby vs Next All of them are amazing!

Lots of them, even in my head. I want to process them later.\nDo you want to ask me a question in the middle of the meeting? \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m thinking about it\u0026rdquo; will be the default answer, unless you press me firmly against the wall.\nSurprisingly, I usually have an answer and opinions for everything.
