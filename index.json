[{"categories":["Architecture"],"contents":"Hey!\nAs I\u0026rsquo;ve documented here I\u0026rsquo;m documenting my journey in creating content, mostly related to Coding, Architecture, Frameworks but also related to Leadership, Startups, and Product Management.\nThis will be a short intro to my blog set up. In the upcoming posts, I\u0026rsquo;ll describe other options and the \u0026ldquo;whys\u0026rdquo; behind the scenes\nStatic Site Generators (SSG) versus Content Management Systems (CMS) That was the first decision. Which one should I use?\nI wanted:\n A blazing fast blog Amazing Markdown support The possibility of avoiding databases usage Just worry about writing content  The requirements matched with Static Site Generators. Simple.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, CMSs are amazing also. We can even work with cache, JavaScript, etc to have a faster website, but this is a story for another post\nHugo vs Jekyll vs Gatsby vs Next All of them are amazing! Really!\nI picked Hugo.\n Fast Simple Written in Go (I personally love) Really fast compilation Flexibility with Shortcodes and Markdown Good themes  Again. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong. Most of them have the same characteristics. Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s just a personal choice, but I\u0026rsquo;ll dissect my choices later\nHosting and Deployment Hugo provides us a beautiful list of places where you can host your site. Hugo renders static pages so you can probably host it anywhere\nHere is a small list:\n AWS Amplify Firebase AWS S3 GitLab Github Pages Netlify  I picked Github Pages\n It\u0026rsquo;s free It\u0026rsquo;s easy You can commit your posts It supports custom domains  Terribly short. I know. I just wanted to give you a taste of how my blog setup looks like\nNext posts I\u0026rsquo;ll explore a few important points:\n My personal comparison between Hugo and Jekyll How to set up an entire blog from scratch using Hugo, GitHub Pages and Godaddy How to choose a specific Hugo Theme How to write your first posts  That\u0026rsquo;s it for today! Thanks for stopping by :)\n","permalink":"https://www.alexgama.io/blog/my-blog-setup-long-story-short-going-through-hugo-github-pages/","tags":["Blog","Go"],"title":"My Blog SetUp - Long Story Short going through Hugo and Github Pages"},{"categories":["Personal"],"contents":"Guilty!\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know about you, but when it comes to personal stuff, I overthink everything.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been waiting for hitting the record button to start youtube videos for more than 3 years! Just a quick note: I haven\u0026rsquo;t hit the button yet ¬¬\nToday I came across this Documenting instead of Creating process and I really loved the idea. Simple and powerful.\nThe way that Sean McCabe puts it really clicks with me. I\u0026rsquo;ve heard about the process before but for some reason I\u0026rsquo;m taking action just right now.\nWhat I desired to do with videos and blog posts? Well, I\u0026rsquo;d like to share content related to topics that I really love, that I\u0026rsquo;m learning and that I have no clue on how to get started\n Coding and Technology Productivity Leadership Business History Lifestyle Music  And the list goes on and on\nBut as a good overthinking person as I am, a have a full and complete set of questions that makes a good job in keeping me far away from my goals in sharing content:\n I\u0026rsquo;m not an English native speaker and I\u0026rsquo;ve learned (I\u0026rsquo;m still learning) English too old. I need to practice for more 5 years to be good enough I don\u0026rsquo;t have the right Youtube gear. What about spending the next 3 years on weekends studying Youtube gears to be good enough? People don\u0026rsquo;t care about what I want to say. Do I have to be creative to get attention? It\u0026rsquo;s a crowded world with amazing content. Why should I bother the world with what I\u0026rsquo;m thinking? This is wrong. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t have good quality. I\u0026rsquo;ll start it over again I have to find the perfect font for this blog What\u0026rsquo;s worth sharing? No one wants to see this  And the list goes on and one again\nAnd you find yourself stuck with a list of things that you can\u0026rsquo;t even see how to get started.\nAnd when you start looking for some answers about overthinking, a few interesting answers come up\nAnd then\nOk Google, that\u0026rsquo;s enough for today\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know about you, but when it comes to professional life, things are really different. For some bizarre reason!\n I\u0026rsquo;m super pragmatic, energetic, and I want to get things done as soon as possible with all of the imperfections because it\u0026rsquo;s amazing to adjust things along the way. It\u0026rsquo;s a beautiful and remarkable process. It really is.\n So, today is a really important day for me :)\nI\u0026rsquo;ll start embracing this terrible and uncomfortable zone of sharing content without overthinking things.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll start documenting the journey instead of overthinking about the content.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to face a lot of problems, imperfections, issues, people laughing at my grammar and pronunciation mistakes and to be honest, for some reason (maybe I\u0026rsquo;m getting too old to care about), I\u0026rsquo;m totally ok with that\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to capture this journey, the issues, the process I\u0026rsquo;m using to surround those issues and then, who knows, I\u0026rsquo;ll look at this in 10 years and I\u0026rsquo;ll be happy to just have started\nStay tuned if you want to see where it goes :)\n","permalink":"https://www.alexgama.io/blog/documenting-instead-of-creating-starting-the-journey/","tags":["Personal"],"title":"Documenting instead of Creating. Starting the Journey"},{"categories":["Personal"],"contents":"I came across this post titled \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m very slow thinker\u0026rdquo; by Derek Sivers and I really liked it. Not just because it\u0026rsquo;s well written but because it\u0026rsquo;s a detailed description of myself\nI usually take a lot of time thinking about questions. In meetings, I usually take notes. Lots of them, even in my head. I want to process them later.\nDo you want to ask me a question in the middle of the meeting? \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m thinking about it\u0026rdquo; will be the default answer, unless you press me firmly against the wall.\nSurprisingly, I usually have an answer and opinions for everything. Even for subjects that I don\u0026rsquo;t know or that I don\u0026rsquo;t care that much.\nBeing these answers and options right or wrong, I have them.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s an interesting scenario since I still want to think about my own opinions. The motivation? Challenging myself. A temptation to avoid some kind of cognitive bias. Or simply, I\u0026rsquo;m too slow\nProbably my first reaction, answer, and motivation will be outdated. I really believe that.\nIf I answer something really quickly, then in the second later, I\u0026rsquo;m trying to invalidate what I\u0026rsquo;ve sad.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not smart enough to have quick answers that are deep and valuable. I prefer to think about them for 5, 10 minutes. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll give you an answer next week.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll grab a beer and I promise thinking about your question while I\u0026rsquo;m sitting on my balcony\nBut I completely understand the art of imperfection and speed. And making decisions. I really do.\nIncomplete answers that can be improved over time. You can compound different perspectives while being in a discussion.\n\u0026ldquo;good is better than perfect\u0026rdquo; someone says. It\u0026rsquo;s outdated but true.\nProbably the brain side that knows it is different from the brain side that takes actions, that answers questions. Who knows.\nAs Derek says, this probably makes me stupid. Different from him, I\u0026rsquo;m usually worried about it. The acceptance phase is still coming. I\u0026rsquo;m waiting. With a beer, on my balcony.\n","permalink":"https://www.alexgama.io/blog/i-am-a-very-slow-thinker/","tags":["Personal"],"title":"I'm a Very Slow Thinker"}]
