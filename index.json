Very simple.\n#1 Repdigit Algorithm Solution One possible solution is\n convert the number into an array take the first digit of the number check if all of the numbers are the same digit  Pretty simple, right?\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see how Ruby handles it.\nStep 1\nThe first step is actually to convert the Integer into a String so that we can be able to manipulate it\narray = number.to_s Step 2\nNow it\u0026rsquo;s time to create the array based on that string\narray = number.to_s.split(\u0026#39;\u0026#39;) Step 3\nFinally, let\u0026rsquo;s convert each string in the array back to an integer\narray = number.to_s.split(\u0026#39;\u0026#39;).map(\u0026amp;:to_i) Step 4\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to take the first digit to compare with all the numbers\ndigit = array.first Step 5\nThen the final step is to count how many digits in that number are different from the first digit\narray = number.to_s.split(\u0026#39;\u0026#39;).map(\u0026amp;:to_i) digit = array.first count = array.count { |item| item != digit } Perfect! If the count variable is different from zero then we have a digit that is different from the first digit, which means that the number is not Repdigit\nThe final solution would be:\ndef is_repdigit(number) array = number.to_s.split(\u0026#39;\u0026#39;).map(\u0026amp;:to_i) digit = array.first count = array.count { |item| item != digit } if count == 0 return true else return false end end puts is_repdigit(777) # tru #2 A Leaner Solution in Ruby A little bit leaner solution would be the following:\ndef is_repdigit_2(number) array = number.to_s.split(\u0026#39;\u0026#39;).map(\u0026amp;:to_i) array.count { |item| item != array.first } == 0 end That\u0026rsquo;s it!\nIn the next video we\u0026rsquo;re going to explore a Ruby Way to solve this algorithm.

This is the post version of the Youtube video :)\nJust a reminder, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if you\u0026rsquo;re using Ruby, Python, JavaScript, or your favorite language, what really matters is the concepts and logic to solve problems\nIf you haven\u0026rsquo;t watched the previous video, I just want to remember the definition of a Factorial number\n A Factorial number N is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to the number N\n We indicate a Factorial number as N!\nReal example:\n5! = 5*4*3*2*1 # result in 120 A possible (and not so beautiful) solution to this problem is the solution in the first video:\ndef factorial(number) result = number while number \u0026gt; 1 result = result * (number - 1) number = number - 1 end return result end puts factorial(5) # 120 Recursion Again, just recalling what the recursion technique is:\n Recursion is when you solve a problem by breaking the problem down into smaller versions of the same problem\n And when it comes to coding, the method or function calls on itself :)\nBefore going to code, let\u0026rsquo;s see the first example:\n5! = 5*4*3*2*1 But you can actually calculate this way:\n5! = 5*4! Because 4! = 432*1, which is a small part of the 5! problem\nYou can go further and say:\n5! = 5*4*3! A little bit more\n5! = 5*4*3*2! And finally\n5! = 5*4*3*2*1 Notice that we\u0026rsquo;ve broken that down into smaller Factorial calculations\nThe recursive Ruby method will be the following:\ndef factorial(number) return 1 if number == 0 return number * factorial(number - 1) end Notice that:\n returns 1 if the number is equal to 0. That\u0026rsquo;s the criteria to stop the method execution returns number * factorial(number - 1) which, as we saw, is a method calling on itself  A more leaner version of this method in Ruby would be:\ndef factorial(number) number == 0 ? 1 : number * factorial(number - 1) end Also notice that:\n We don\u0026rsquo;t need to explicitly use return in Ruby We\u0026rsquo;re using a ternary condition, which in our case makes the readability (in my opinion) much better  That\u0026rsquo;s it!\nHope you liked it and see you tomorrow in the next challenge :)\n  Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to keep in touch and say hi Alex\nTwitter Youtube Instagram Linkedin GitHub\n","permalink":"https://www.alexgama.io/ruby/30-ruby-coding-challenges-in-30-days/ruby-coding-challenge-10-recursive-factorial-algorithm/","tags":["Ruby Series","30DaysCoding"],"title":"Day 10 of 30 - Ruby Coding Challenge - Recursive Factorial Numbers"},{"categories":["Ruby"],"contents":"Hey folks!\nIn today\u0026rsquo;s post, which is the writing version of the Youtube video, we\u0026rsquo;ll finally achieve our dreams of writing the Factorial Algorithm in a more Ruby way.

Translating into Ruby code:\ndef sum_prime_number(array) sum = 0 for item in array if is_prime_number(item) sum += item end end return sum end array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] puts sum_prime_number(array) Cool. But what about the lovable Ruby way to solve problems?\n#3 - Ruby Way One important Ruby style is that we can manipulate arrays without worrying about temporary variables. Nice!\nGoing in parts, we can at least two favors to Ruby:\n Hey Ruby, given an array, select only items that match a specific condition  array.select { |item| is_prime(item) } Beautiful. Almost plain English.\nIf you execute the code above, you\u0026rsquo;ll end up with a smaller array, with only prime numbers:\narray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] puts array.select { |item| is_prime(item) } # result: [2, 3, 5, 7] The next step is asking Ruby another favor:\n Hey Ruby, by the way, now that you have an array with only prime numbers, reduce this array into a sum of all of the items  array.select{ |item| is_prime(item) }.reduce(:+) Beautifully, Ruby has the method reduce(), which receives the + method that will be used to sum all of the items\nThe complete code:\ndef sum_prime_number(array) array.select{ |item| is_prime(item) }.reduce(:+) end def is_prime(item) return false if item == 1 (2..(item - 1)).each do |number| if item % number == 0 return false end end return true end array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] puts sum_prime_number(array) Notice that we ended up having a more functional style, since this code is more declarative.

It\u0026rsquo;s divided by 2 5 is prime 6 is not prime. It\u0026rsquo;s divided by 2 and 3 7 is prime 8 is not prime. It\u0026rsquo;s divided by 2 and 4 9 is not prime. It\u0026rsquo;s divided by 3 10 is not prime. It\u0026rsquo;s divided by 2 and 5  Yep, you got it.\n#2 Prime Number Algorithm in Ruby Are you familiar with Ruby? If yes, then probably you\u0026rsquo;re already aware of the Prime library. This is an unfair advantage.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to talk about that later but for now let\u0026rsquo;s stick with the old and good manual process.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s time to create the code skeleton. A method waiting for an array:\ndef count_prime_number_version_1(array) # magic will happen here end array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] puts count_prime_number_version_1(array) Just for clarity, I\u0026rsquo;m going to create a variable, which indicates the total count:\ndef count_prime_number_version_1(array) prime_count = 0 # a loop expression here return prime_count end array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] puts count_prime_number_version_1(array) It\u0026rsquo;s time to go through the array and ask for each item if they are prime or not\ndef count_prime_number_version_1(array) prime_count = 0 for item in array end return prime_count end We know that 1 is not prime, so why not just ignore it?\nIn Ruby we use next to say: \u0026ldquo;Hey Ruby, forget this item and jump to the next item\u0026rdquo;\nAre you coming from Java, Python or Javascript? That\u0026rsquo;s the same with continue\ndef count_prime_number_version_1(array) prime_count = 0 for item in array next if item == 1 end return prime_count end How can we validate in Ruby if a number is divided by another number, resulting in a remainder zero?\nWith percent %\n# checking if the remainder value is zero when dividing an item by count item % count == 0 Ok, now we can write a while loop that\n given an item check if there\u0026rsquo;s a number that divides the item, remaining in zero  is_prime = true number = item - 1 while number \u0026gt; 1 if item % number != 0 number = number - 1 else is_prime = false break end end Notice that\n we\u0026rsquo;re using is_prime to indicate when an item is, well, prime we\u0026rsquo;re using break to stop the while loop once the item is divided by a number, which already means that it\u0026rsquo;s not prime  It\u0026rsquo;s time to risk our virtual friendship. The complete code:\ndef count_prime_number_version_1(array) prime_count = 0 for item in array next if item == 1 is_prime = true number = item - 1 while number \u0026gt; 1 if item % number == 0 is_prime = false break else number = number - 1 end end if is_prime prime_count = prime_count + 1 end end return prime_count end array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] puts count_prime_number_version_1(array) What I want to prove?\n I write terrible code at first and I\u0026rsquo;m not even sorry I don\u0026rsquo;t worry about design, performance, etc on the first version. Just get the job done (and lose some friends on the way) For beginners, it\u0026rsquo;s probably a good way to go through this process  As I said, this algorithm will become beautiful (hopefully), or at least better in the upcoming video and we\u0026rsquo;ll be friends again.\nSee you\nTwitter Youtube Instagram Linkedin\n  ","permalink":"https://www.alexgama.io/ruby/30-ruby-coding-challenges-in-30-days/ruby-coding-challenge-2-prime-numbers-algorithm/","tags":["Ruby Series","30DaysCoding"],"title":"Day 2 of 30 - Ruby Coding Challenge - Ugly Prime Algorithm"},{"categories":["Ruby"],"contents":"Hey!\nDay 3 of 30: Ruby Coding Challenge number 3.\nThis is the post version of this video on Youtube\nIn the previous video we solved a really common challenge:\n How many prime items are in a given array\n The final code was terrible.

When it comes to algorithms, decoration means a few things:\n Better performance Better readability Better maintainability  Well, better code design\nToday I\u0026rsquo;ll solve the same problem with (I hope) a better code design:\nBelow you can see the first ugly version:\n#1 - Ugly Algorithm Version def count_prime_number_version_1(array) prime_count = 0 for item in array next if item == 1 is_prime = true number = item - 1 while number \u0026gt; 1 if item % number == 0 is_prime = false break else number = number - 1 end end if is_prime prime_count = prime_count + 1 end end return prime_count end array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] puts count_prime_number_version_1(array) It\u0026rsquo;s time to organize the kitchen. It would be great to have a method that verifies if a given number is prime.\n#2 - Method Organization We have 2 main responsibilities\n iterate over the array, asking questions validate if a given number is prime or not  I\u0026rsquo;m going to split this into 2 methods, which will have those responsibilities above:\ndef count_prime_number_version_2(array) count_prime = 0 for item in array if is_prime(item) # the new method. it\u0026#39;s better. It\u0026#39;s clearer count_prime = count_prime + 1 end end return count_prime end def is_prime(item) return false if item == 1 count = item - 1 while count \u0026gt; 1 if item % count == 0 return false end count = count - 1 end return true end Cool.

Notice that we\u0026rsquo;re importing the Prime library\nrequire \u0026#39;Prime\u0026#39; Prime.prime?(item) Going ahead and replacing the is_prime(item) method:\ndef count_prime_version_6(array) array.count do |item| Prime.prime?(item) end end And that\u0026rsquo;s our final version, a little bit different than the first one 😏\ndef count_prime_final_version(array) array.count do |item| Prime.prime?(item) end end array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] puts count_prime_final_version(array) That\u0026rsquo;s it. I hope that you\u0026rsquo;ve learned 1 thing or 2 : )\n  Thinking out loud here, probably the next coding challenge will be rewriting the Algorithm manually using Recursion 😏\nThanks for your visit, let\u0026rsquo;s keep in touch and see you!\nTwitter Youtube Instagram Linkedin\n","permalink":"https://www.alexgama.io/ruby/30-ruby-coding-challenges-in-30-days/ruby-coding-challenge-3-better-prime-algorithm/","tags":["Ruby Series","30DaysCoding"],"title":"Day 3 of 30 - Ruby Coding Challenge - Better Prime Algorithm :)"},{"categories":["Ruby"],"contents":"Hey!\nDay 4 of 30: Ruby Coding Challenge number 4. This is the post version of the Youtube video\nI want to rewrite the coding challenge number 3 using recursion, which was:\n How many prime items are in a given array?\n Let\u0026rsquo;s get into it.\n#1 - First Algorithm Version It was the final algorithm version:\ndef count_prime_number_version_2(array) array.count do |item| is_prime_number(item) end end def is_prime_number(item) return false if item == 1 (2..(item - 1)).each do |number| if item % number == 0 return false end end return true end array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] puts count_prime_number_recursively(array) Instead of having that array loop in the is_prime_number() method:\ndef is_prime_number(item) return false if item == 1 (2..(item - 1)).each do |number| if item % number == 0 return false end end return true end We\u0026rsquo;re going to rewrite this method using recursion.\n#1 Recursive Algorithms I know. Recursion is one of the monsters when it comes to coding, along with memory management and giving names to variables.\nJust a quick reminder:\n A recursive algorithm calls itself with a smaller version of its own problem\n I\u0026rsquo;m not going to go into much detail about recursion because I\u0026rsquo;m kind of assuming you already know something about it, however, I might be wrong. Because of that, I\u0026rsquo;m recording and writing a special tutorial to go through the benefits (and some costs) of recursive algorithms 😏\nStep 1:\n A recursive function calls itself  def is_prime_number(item) return is_prime_number(item) end Step 2:\n we need at least one condition to call the function again, which is when item is not evenly dividable by number  def is_prime_number(item) return is_prime_number(item) if item % number != 0 end Step 3:\n we already know that 1 is not a prime number as we\u0026rsquo;ve seen in the previous algorithm  def is_prime_number(item) return false if item == 1 return is_prime_number(item) if item % number != 0 end Step 4:\n we should call the method itself with the current number - 1, which is the logic we have using so far  def is_prime_number(item, number) return false if item == 1 return is_prime_number(item, number - 1) if item % number != 0 end Step 5:\n we should return true if numbers reaches 1, which means that the number is actual prime  def is_prime_number(item, number) return false if item == 1 return true if number == 1 return is_prime_number(item, number - 1) if item % number != 0 end The entire code is:\ndef count_prime_numbers(array) array.count do |item| is_prime_number(item, item - 1) end end def is_prime_number(item, number) return false if item == 1 return true if number == 1 return is_prime_number(item, number - 1) if item % number != 0 end array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] puts count_prime_numbers(array) And that\u0026rsquo;s it!\nTo be honest, this is not an easy topic (at least for me) to explain in writing and maybe you get a better picture watching the video :)\nJust a reminder.

Let\u0026rsquo;s get into it : )\n#1 Logic to Solve the Problem Yes, the logic is pretty simple. Again, just to stretch our legs and arms to the run\n Given an array Go through all of the numbers For each number you compare if the number is greater than 5 You increment a variable (let\u0026rsquo;s call it count) You print the variable count after going through the array  #2 Classic For Loop Expression Again, don\u0026rsquo;t worry about the Ruby syntax. Focus on concepts and logic.\nFor the code below we\u0026rsquo;ve created a classic for loop expression and for each item in the given array, we\u0026rsquo;re checking if the number is greater than 5, just like the previous logic\narray = [15, 7, 3, 2, 17, 12, 1] count = 0; for item in array if item \u0026gt; 5 count += 1 end end puts count # prints out the count value, which is 4. Nice #3 Organizing with a Method Nothing special here. Just organizing the kitchen with a method.\nNotice that we\u0026rsquo;re taking a number as an argument, which will be the number used to compare the items in the array\ndef how_many_are_greater_than(number, array) count = 0; for item in array if item \u0026gt; number count += 1 end end return count # in Ruby we don\u0026#39;t need to use return btw end array = [15, 7 , 3, 2, 17, 12, 1] count = how_many_are_greater_than(5, array) # a little bit better, isn\u0026#39;t it? puts count Pretty simple, right?\nWhat about doing that in a more Rubyish way? 😏\n#4 Hipster Time: Blocks in Ruby Bonus hipster time.\nRuby (as many other languages) has its own way to do a few things and that is called Ruby Way or Rubyish Way to do things\nAn array in Ruby provides a method called count(), which receives a block that can be an expression to be evaluated\narray.count do |item| item \u0026gt; number end Notice that:\n item: is just a single item from our array. This block magically automatically executes a for loop expression item \u0026gt; number: is the expression to be evaluated for each item  The complete code:\ndef how_many_are_greater_than_rubyish(number, array) array.count do |item| item \u0026gt; number end end array = [15, 7 , 3, 2, 17, 12, 1] count = how_many_are_greater_than_rubyish(5, array) puts count But wait. Where is the count variable and how we return it? Brilliant question.\nRuby automatically increments an internal variable each time the expression item \u0026gt; number is evaluated to true and keeps the result in this\ninternal variable.\nWhen the execution is finished, Ruby automatically returns the result for us\nDon\u0026rsquo;t believe me? Check the code below:\ndef how_many_are_greater_than_rubyish(number, array) return array.count do |item| item \u0026gt; number end end array = [15, 7 , 3, 2, 17, 12, 1] count = how_many_are_greater_than_rubyish(5) puts count Now I\u0026rsquo;m explicitly using the return keyword, which will behave in the same way, returning the final result after the expression being evaluated for each item in the array.\nThis is a more declarative approach than an imperative one, but this is a discussion for an upcoming article.\nWell done, Ruby! 💪\n  That\u0026rsquo;s it.

I\u0026rsquo;m just playing around with some code snippets to be easier to understand :)\nAre you ready? Let\u0026rsquo;s get into it\n#1: Using CDI 2.0 in a Standalone Mode It\u0026rsquo;s a good time to review the code from the previous part of this series, which runs CDI in a standalone mode. it\u0026rsquo;s nice and easier for our journey\nFirst of all, let\u0026rsquo;s create the MainApplication class that will start the CDI Container.\nJust a reminder, in the following code we\u0026rsquo;re using CDI 2.0, but Qualifiers came out in the version 1.0. Cool\npublic class MainApplication { public static void main(String[] args) { try (CDI\u0026lt;object\u0026gt; container = new Weld().initialize()) { Checkout checkout = container.select(Checkout.class).get(); checkout.finishCheckout(); } } } Of course, this code doesn\u0026rsquo;t compile since we don\u0026rsquo;t have the Checkout class yet.\n#2: Creating the Checkout Class Let\u0026rsquo;s create the Checkout class, which uses the SimpleLogger classes:\npublic class Checkout { @Inject private SimpleLogger logger; public void finishCheckout() { logger.log(\u0026#34;Finishing Checkout\u0026#34;); // our really advanced logger 😅 \t} } That code doesn\u0026rsquo;t compile either. It\u0026rsquo;s time to create the SimpleLogger class.\n#3: Creating the SimpleLogger Class This class will just log a message based on a configuration mode.\npublic class SimpleLogger { private LogConfiguration configuration; public SimpleLogger(LogConfiguration configuration) { this.configuration = configuration; } public void log(String message) { if (configuration.isInDebugMode()) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;DEBUG LOG: \u0026#34; + message); } else if (configuration.isInInfoMode()) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;DEBUG LOG: \u0026#34; + message); } else { System.out.println(\u0026#34;DEFAULT LOG: \u0026#34; + message); } } } As you can see, we have the class LogConfiguration, which configures the mode to be used when printing out a log message.\n#4: Creating the LogConfiguration class This class will contain 3 modes to be passed to the SimpleLogger class:\npublic class LogConfiguration { private boolean infoMode; private boolean debugMode; private boolean warnMode; public LogConfiguration(boolean infoMode, boolean debugMode, boolean warnMode) { this.infoMode = infoMode; this.debugMode = debugMode; this.warnMode = warnMode; } public boolean isInInfoMode() { return infoMode; } public boolean isInDebugMode() { return debugMode; } public boolean isInWarnMode() { return warnMode; } } Notice that the SimpleLogger class should have a LogConfiguration object built.\nIn this case, we should create a Factory to teach CDI how to create a SimpleLogger object.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s move on and create the factory!\n#5: Factory With @Produces in CDI We\u0026rsquo;re going to use the @Produces annotation to create a Factory to build a SimpleLogger object.\nThis object will be built with the boolean debugMode as true to indicate that a message should be printed out in the debug mode.\npublic class SimpleLoggerFactory { @Produces public SimpleLogger createLogger() { LogConfiguration logInDebugMode = new LogConfiguration(false, true, false); // I know, taking 3 booleans as parameters...🙄  return new SimpleLogger(logInDebugMode); } } Great! So far we\u0026rsquo;ve just taken a quick overview from the previous post.\n#6: More Logger Modes As you may notice, so far, we have just 1 mode to work with Logger, the Debug mode!\nBut we\u0026rsquo;d like to use another Logger mode, for example, Info mode. How can we do that?\nThe first and simplest way to solve this: Create another method in the Factory, which creates a Logger object that uses the Info mode\nLet\u0026rsquo;s explore this solution!\npublic class SimpleLoggerFactory { @Produces public SimpleLogger createDebugLogger() { // yes, I renamed it  boolean debugMode = true; // just to be clear that the debug mode is on  LogConfiguration logInDebugMode = new LogConfiguration(false, debugMode, false); return new SimpleLogger(logInDebugMode); } @Produces public SimpleLogger createInfoLogger() { //new method here :)  boolean infoMode = true; LogConfiguration logInInfoMode = new LogConfiguration(infoMode, false, false); return new SimpleLogger(logInInfoMode); } } Yes, we renamed the previous method just to be clearer that a Debug Logger will be created and, besides that, we\u0026rsquo;ve created a new method called createInfoLogger().\nNotice that both methods are using the @Produces annotation and, yes, CDI allows us to have many methods annotated with @Produces annotation in the same class.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s run the code?\nWELD-001409: Ambiguous dependencies for type SimpleLogger with qualifiers @Default at injection point [BackedAnnotatedField] @Inject private com.craftcoder.cdi.qualifiers.Checkout.logger at com.craftcoder.cdi.qualifiers.Checkout.logger(Checkout.java:0) Possible dependencies: - Producer Method [SimpleLogger] with qualifiers [@Any @Default] declared as [[BackedAnnotatedMethod] @Produces public com.hackingcode.cdi.qualifiers.SimpleLoggerFactory.createInfoLogger()], - Producer Method [SimpleLogger] with qualifiers [@Any @Default] declared as [[BackedAnnotatedMethod] @Produces public com.hackingcode.cdi.qualifiers.SimpleLoggerFactory.createDebugLogger()] Nice, an exception has thrown on our faces! What happened?\nWhen CDI tries to inject a SimpleLogger object based on the Factory:\n CDI doesn\u0026rsquo;t understand and can\u0026rsquo;t choose which method should be used when the SimpleLogger object is needed.\n CDI will angrily say:\n Hey, I have 2 methods that create the object that you are interested in. You should teach me which one I should pick up.\n And that really makes sense. CDI doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the ability to understand your desire when you\u0026rsquo;re injecting a dependency if you have more than 2 objects to be returned.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s teach CDI how to pick up the desired Logger to be injected.\n#7: Polymorphism With @Qualifiers There is a brilliant annotation called @Qualifiers since the version 1.0.\nWith this annotation, we can teach CDI which method should be used and CDI tries to create the correct object for us.\nFirst of all, we need to mark our createDebugLogger() method, indicating that this method will use the Debug mode.\nHow can we mark classes or methods in Java? Using annotations! So, let\u0026rsquo;s create our own annotation 😈\n@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) @Target({ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.FIELD}) public @interface DebugMode { } Easy, right?\nNotice that the ElementType on the annotation indicates where this annotation should be used. In our case, this will be used on methods and fields.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve created the DebugMode annotation and we will mark the method createDebugLogger()\npublic class SimpleLoggerFactory { @Produces @DebugMode public SimpleLogger createDebugLogger() { boolean debugMode = true; LogConfiguration logInDebugMode = new LogConfiguration(false, debugMode, false); return new SimpleLogger(logInDebugMode); } //another method here.. } It\u0026rsquo;s time to CDI be aware of that new annotation by using the @Qualifier annotation:\n@Qualifier @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) @Target(ElementType.METHOD) public @interface DebugMode { }  Now CDI knows that the DebugMode annotation is a qualified annotation and will be used to filter which method should be used when a new Logger is requested.\n Let\u0026rsquo;s run it?\nINFO: WELD-ENV-002003: Weld SE container STATIC_INSTANCE initialized INFO LOG: Finishing Checkout Feb 15, 2017 8:09:57 AM org.jboss.weld.environment.se.WeldContainer shutdown INFO: WELD-ENV-002001: Weld SE container STATIC_INSTANCE shut down Is everything working properly?\nNot so fast! As you can see, we are printing out the INFO LOG, right? But we\u0026rsquo;d like to print out the DEBUG LOG.\nYes, CDI requires us to specify explicitly which Qualifier should be used. If you don\u0026rsquo;t pass any Qualifier, CDI will use its default Qualifier, called\u0026hellip;@Default!\nBehind the curtains, the method createInfoLogger() uses a @Default qualifier annotation:\npublic class SimpleLoggerFactory { @Produces @Default // yes, it is here by default, however you dont\u0026#39;t need to use it explicitly!  public SimpleLogger createInfoLogger() { boolean infoMode = true; LogConfiguration logInInfoMode = new LogConfiguration(infoMode, false, false); return new SimpleLogger(logInInfoMode); } } And notice that CDI will configure the @Default Qualifier on the injection point:\npublic class Checkout { @Inject @Default // it\u0026#39;s here again!  private SimpleLogger logger; public void finishCheckout() { logger.log(\u0026#34;Finishing Checkout\u0026#34;); } } So, keep in mind that we always have the @Default annotation when we don\u0026rsquo;t specify a CDI Qualifier.\n#8: Choosing Another Qualifier in the Injection Point Now it\u0026rsquo;s easy to choose the Debug Mode on the Injection Point:\npublic class Checkout { @Inject @DebugMode // debug mode now  private SimpleLogger logger; public void finishCheckout() { logger.log(\u0026#34;Finishing Checkout\u0026#34;); } } Let\u0026rsquo;s run it again!\nINFO: WELD-ENV-002003: Weld SE container STATIC_INSTANCE initialized DEBUG LOG: Finishing Checkout Feb 15, 2017 8:26:41 AM org.jboss.weld.environment.se.WeldContainer shutdown INFO: WELD-ENV-002001: Weld SE container STATIC_INSTANCE shut down Now everything is working perfectly!\n#9: Creating More Log Modes using Qualifiers It\u0026rsquo;s worth mentioning that:\n Qualifiers bring to us the ability to use polymorphism at the Injection Point\n So, it\u0026rsquo;s time to create a new Qualifier to the INFO and WARN modes to get the benefits from Polymorphism and CDI:\n@Qualifier @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) @Target({ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.FIELD}) public @interface InfoMode { } @Qualifier @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) @Target({ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.FIELD}) public @interface WarnMode { } And the entirely SimpleLoggerFactory class should be as follows:\npublic class SimpleLoggerFactory { @Produces @DebugMode public SimpleLogger createDebugLogger() { boolean debugMode = true; LogConfiguration logInDebugMode = new LogConfiguration(false, debugMode, false); return new SimpleLogger(logInDebugMode); } @Produces @InfoMode public SimpleLogger createInfoLogger() { boolean infoMode = true; LogConfiguration logInInfoMode = new LogConfiguration(infoMode, false, false); return new SimpleLogger(logInInfoMode); } @Produces @WarnMode public SimpleLogger createWarnLogger() { boolean warnMode = true; LogConfiguration logInWarnMode = new LogConfiguration(false, false, warnMode); return new SimpleLogger(logInWarnMode); } } Using the WARN mode:\n@Inject @WarnMode private SimpleLogger logger; If you run the code again, the message will be printed out using WARN mode!\n#10: @Qualifiers With Arguments We\u0026rsquo;ve created 3 Log modes so far. But what would be your life if we needed 5 more modes?\nCreating 5 more annotations doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound like a good idea.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s time to refactor our code by using Qualifiers with arguments to have less code being written.\nYes, Qualifiers accept arguments in their annotations!\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll create a new annotation called @LoggerMode, a more generic annotation:\n@Qualifier @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) @Target({ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.FIELD}) public @interface LoggerMode { } We can use an Enum to indicate which mode we would like to use in the annotation:\nenum Mode { DEBUG, INFO, WARN } The complete Qualifier code will be:\n@Qualifier @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) @Target({ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.FIELD}) public @interface LoggerMode { Mode desiredMode(); } Pretty cool! We just need to change the methods on the Factory class to use the new annotation with the desiredMode option configured:\npublic class SimpleLoggerFactory { @Produces @LoggerMode(desiredMode = Mode.DEBUG) public SimpleLogger createDebugLogger() { ... } @Produces @LoggerMode(desiredMode = Mode.INFO) public SimpleLogger createInfoLogger() { ... } @Produces @LoggerMode(desiredMode = Mode.WARN) public SimpleLogger createWarnLogger() { ... } } Now we can remove all the 3 annotations and end up by having only 1, the @LoggerMode annotation!\nIf we have 5 more Log Modes to be created, don\u0026rsquo;t worry, you can create 5 more types on your Enum! Brilliant!\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it! I hope you\u0026rsquo;ve learned 1 thing or 2 and thanks for stopping by, really appreciate :)\nSee you on the next Part 3 - Observing Events\nLet\u0026rsquo;s keep in touch and don\u0026rsquo;t forget to signup for my weekly newsletter 🙂\nTwitter Youtube Instagram Linkedin\n","permalink":"https://www.alexgama.io/java/cdi-series/cdi-in-java-series-part-2-qualifiers/","tags":["CDI Series","Beginners Tutorial"],"title":"CDI in Java - Part 2 - Polymorphism with CDI Qualifiers"},{"categories":["Java"],"contents":"Hey friend!\nThis is Part 1 of the CDI Series in Java that contains:\n Part 1: Factory in CDI with the @Produces annotation Part 2: CDI Qualifiers Part 3: Events and Observers in CDI Part 4: CDI and Lazy Initialization Part 5: Interceptors in CDI Part 6: CDI Dependency Injection and Alternatives Part 7: Working with CDI Decorators  In this post, we\u0026rsquo;re going to take a look at the amazing @Produces annotation, which is probably one of the most important and used annotations in the CDI world in Java!\nSetting the expectation\nBefore getting started, let\u0026rsquo;s be on the same page.

Let me know if you want more detailed points :)\nProblem contextualization\nIt\u0026rsquo;s time to contextualize our challenge! We\u0026rsquo;d like to create the following steps for our pseudo online store:\n Create a Checkout class to\u0026hellip; you know\u0026hellip; buy something Log the operations on the console. Create a Logger class to keep this log in its own class. The famous cohesion. Customize this Logger to receive a Configuration, which indicates which Log Mode should be used  Pretty simple, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? Let\u0026rsquo;s jump crazily into code!\n#1: Creating the Main class in CDI 2.0 Before creating the main class to execute our CDI code, let\u0026rsquo;s create the important Checkout class:\npublic class Checkout { public void finishCheckout() { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Finishing Checkout\u0026#34;); } } Great!\nIn this example, we\u0026rsquo;re going to use CDI 2.0, which allows us to use CDI in a standalone fashion!\nLet\u0026rsquo;s bring the CDI power by creating a CDI Container, which allows us to instantiate objects\nCDI\u0026lt;Object\u0026gt; container = new Weld().initialize() Nice! Below we have a Checkout object instance created by CDI:\npublic class MainApplication { public static void main(String[] args) { try (CDI\u0026lt;Object\u0026gt; container = new Weld().initialize()) { Checkout checkout = container.select(Checkout.class).get(); checkout.finishCheckout(); } } } Pretty easy, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? Notice the following code:\nCheckout checkout = container.select(Checkout.class).get(); That code is the same as the following, which is injecting a Checkout object using the remarkable @Inject annotation:\n@Inject private Checkout checkout; Now, it\u0026rsquo;s time to execute our CDI example, to validate our environment!\nYou will see on your console something like this:\nINFO: WELD-ENV-002003: Weld SE container STATIC_INSTANCE initialized Finishing Checkout Great! Everything is up and running!\n#2: Creating a Specialized Class for Logger Logging is something important for us. To have good cohesion, let\u0026rsquo;s create a class that is responsible for logging messages.\nThis class will be called SpecialLogger, as you can see below:\npublic class SpecialLogger { public void log(String message) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;LOG: \u0026#34; + message); //ok, not that special 😒  } } Perfect! Now we\u0026rsquo;d like to update the Checkout class to use the newest Logger class:\npublic class Checkout { private SpecialLogger logger; public void finishCheckout() { logger.log(\u0026#34;Finishing Checkout\u0026#34;); } } Sounds good, because now the Checkout class doesn\u0026rsquo;t know how a Logger works under the hood, we\u0026rsquo;re just using it!\n#3: Logging Mode to Log Messages Through a Special Configuration it would be great to have a way to change the mode that the log is printed out. These modes could be the following:\n Debug Mode Info Mode Error Mode Etc.  Our SpecialLogger should receive the desired Log Mode and print out the message using it.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s time to create the Configuration class that will receive the Log mode:\npublic class LogConfiguration { private boolean infoMode; private boolean debugMode; public LogConfiguration(boolean infoMode, boolean debugMode) { this.infoMode = infoMode; this.debugMode = debugMode; } public boolean isInInfoMode() { return infoMode; } public boolean isInDebugMode() { return debugMode; } } I know, that\u0026rsquo;s not the best code design, but I just want to keep the example clean and simple.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s change the SpecialLogger class to be able to Log a message based on the LogConfiguration:\npublic class SpecialLogger { @Inject private LogConfiguration configuration; public SpecialLogger(LogConfiguration configuration) { this.configuration = configuration; } public void log(String message) { if (configuration.isInDebugMode()) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;DEBUG LOG: \u0026#34; + message); } else if (configuration.isInInfoMode()) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;DEBUG LOG: \u0026#34; + message); } else { System.out.println(\u0026#34;DEFAULT LOG: \u0026#34; + message); } } } As you can see, we\u0026rsquo;re validating whether the log should use the Debug or Info mode, otherwise, the message must be printed out by using the Default mode.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s try to run it:\nWELD-001408: Unsatisfied dependencies for type SpecialLogger with qualifiers @Default at injection point [BackedAnnotatedField] @Inject private com.hackingcode.cdi.produces.Checkout.logger Yes, an exception will be thrown on our faces. And that makes sense. CDI does not know how to inject the SpecialLogger object yet.\nCDI, behind the scenes, will execute the following steps:\n Hey, I can see that you need a SpecialLogger object here. That\u0026rsquo;s ok for me. I\u0026rsquo;ll try to find this class around your classpath I\u0026rsquo;ve found this SpecialLogger class on your classpath I\u0026rsquo;ll try to create a new SpecialLogger instance for you right now Ohhh, I can\u0026rsquo;t do that! The SpecialLogger receives a LogConfiguration in its constructor. I don\u0026rsquo;t even know what it is and I don\u0026rsquo;t know how to create it!  It\u0026rsquo;s time to teach CDI how to get the job done and create the LogConfiguration class!\n#4: Creating a Factory With the @Produces Annotation It\u0026rsquo;s time to create a Factory to create the SpecialLogger based on the LogConfiguration:\npublic class SpecialLoggerFactory { public SpecialLogger createLogger() { LogConfiguration logInDebugMode = new LogConfiguration(true, false); return new SpecialLogger(logInDebugMode); } } It\u0026rsquo;s a pretty simple Factory class. It has the method createLogger(), which returns a LogConfiguration object.\nBut CDI doesn\u0026rsquo;t know about this class yet or its method! Let\u0026rsquo;s use the annotation @Produces.\npublic class SpecialLoggerFactory { @Produces public SpecialLogger createLogger() { LogConfiguration logInDebugMode = new LogConfiguration(true, false); return new SpecialLogger(logInDebugMode); } }  @Produces indicates to CDI that the method createLogger() should be used when a LogConfiguration object is needed\n The @Produces annotation will say to CDI:\n Hey CDI, please, use the createLogger() method when you need to Inject a SpecialLogger object in some place\n Of course, the returned object of the method createLogger() must be the same type that you\u0026rsquo;re interested in, in this case, the SpecialLogger. Generics for an upcoming post 😏.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it! I really hope that this article could be helpful to you!\nIn the next part, we\u0026rsquo;re going to be hacking some code with CDI and Qualifiers\nSee you on Twitter for more updates :)\nLet\u0026rsquo;s keep in touch and don\u0026rsquo;t forget to signup for my weekly newsletter 🙂\nTwitter Youtube Instagram Linkedin\n","permalink":"https://www.alexgama.io/java/cdi-series/cdi-in-java-series-part-1-creating-a-factory-using-produces-annotation/","tags":["CDI Series","Beginners Tutorial"],"title":"CDI in Java - Part 1 - Creating a Factory with @Produces Annotation"},{"categories":["Java"],"contents":"Hey!\nThis post is coming this week, I promise 😅\nJust join my newsletter to receive all updates :)\n","permalink":"https://www.alexgama.io/java/cdi-series/cdi-in-java-series-part-3-events-and-observers/","tags":["CDI Series","Beginners Tutorial"],"title":"CDI in Java - Part 3 - Events and Observers"},{"categories":["Java"],"contents":"Hey!\nThis post is coming this week, I promise 😅\nJust join my newsletter to receive all updates :)\n","permalink":"https://www.alexgama.io/java/cdi-series/cdi-in-java-series-part-4-lazy-initialization/","tags":["CDI Series","Beginners Tutorial"],"title":"CDI in Java - Part 4 - Lazy Initialization"},{"categories":["Java"],"contents":"Hey!\nThis post is coming this week, I promise 😅\nJust join my newsletter to receive all updates :)\n","permalink":"https://www.alexgama.io/java/cdi-series/cdi-in-java-series-part-5-interceptors/","tags":["CDI Series","Beginners Tutorial"],"title":"CDI in Java - Part 5 - Interceptors"},{"categories":["Java"],"contents":"Hey!\nThis post is coming this week, I promise 😅\nJust join my newsletter to receive all updates :)\n","permalink":"https://www.alexgama.io/java/cdi-series/cdi-in-java-series-part-6-dependency-injection-alternatives/","tags":["CDI Series","Beginners Tutorial"],"title":"CDI in Java - Part 6 - Dependency Injection and Alternatives"},{"categories":["Java"],"contents":"Hey!\nThis post is coming this week, I promise 😅\nJust join my newsletter to receive all updates :)\n","permalink":"https://www.alexgama.io/java/cdi-series/cdi-in-java-series-part-7-decorators/","tags":["CDI Series","Beginners Tutorial"],"title":"CDI in Java - Part 7 - Decorators"},{"categories":["Marketing"],"contents":"Hey!\nRunning out of time?

Taking notes is really time consuming Being more active when it comes to consuming data Keeping my memory in some artificial place.

Just embrace it and learn through the journey and feedbacks split the content into several different parts and share them over the week recording a podcast? film yourself while you\u0026rsquo;re recording. You can share some important pieces via social media improve quality over time, but forget it for now. Focus on quantity with consistency even with fancy gear, you can keep it simple when it comes to sharing single pieces of content don\u0026rsquo;t worry about social media rules.

This is the discovery of the day and I want to share it.\nAre you immersed in the JavaScript world? Or are you just getting started?\nIn both contexts probably you have heard about React. Old like me? Probably React.js\nReact Just a terrible overview:\n React is a JavaScript library React allows us to build rich user interfaces React allows us to build single-page applications React allows us to build mobile applications React is based on components  One interesting point is that React allows us to manipulate/render data. This is a more Stateless approach, which means that React has a short memory, on purpose btw.\n Request A renders my name on the page Request B completely forgets the rendered name  But usually, life works in mysterious ways and we need to know what happened previously. That\u0026rsquo;s when State Management comes handy.\nReact has friends. React has an important friend. Redux\nRedux If you want to have a good memory, if you want to be aware of the data you\u0026rsquo;re rendering between requests, then you\u0026rsquo;re thinking about Redux\nMy terrible overview again:\n Redux is a JavaScript Library (makes some sense, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?) Redux manages the application state Follows the reducing function approach (which I\u0026rsquo;m gonna tell you more about later)  it sounds that React has a new friend for State Management. Welcome Recoil :)\nRecoil I\u0026rsquo;ve just discovered Recoil from Twitter, as we discover everything in life.\nTo be honest, I don\u0026rsquo;t know yet how it works but the pitch is great\n You can share state easily Functional concepts in its core Create subscriptions to listen events asynchronously (my dream is to write this word correctly on the first attempt) Amazing granularity with Atoms and Selectors  If I have some time, I\u0026rsquo;ll play around with Recoil on my weekend and give you guys a better and detailed description.\nThanks for stopping by and see you tomorrow :)\nLet\u0026rsquo;s keep in touch 🙂\nTwitter Youtube Instagram Linkedin\n","permalink":"https://www.alexgama.io/javascript/planning-to-manage-state-with-react-welcome-recoil/","tags":["GraphQL","Architecture"],"title":"Planning to Manage State with React?

Which one should I use?\nI wanted:\n A blazing fast blog Amazing Markdown support The possibility of avoiding databases usage Just worry about writing content  The requirements matched with Static Site Generators. Simple.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong again, CMSs are amazing also.

Lots of them, even in my head. I want to process them later.\nDo you want to ask me a question in the middle of the meeting? \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m thinking about it\u0026rdquo; will be the default answer, unless you press me firmly against the wall.\nSurprisingly, I usually have an answer and opinions for everything.
